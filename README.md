# for_fun
Random program that does random things to test things and stuff. Just gonna do 
random stuff and things here.

There is a fork in the road, two paths. You take the right one and reach the
end. You find out the other path's details and find it is a path stuck in
implimentation. You know the path you went on and its output. Would you prefer
the other path. Touch grass bitch ass fake god on earth.
